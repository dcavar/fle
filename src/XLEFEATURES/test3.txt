"THIS IS A PRELIMINARY VERSION OF THE UPDATED COMMON FEATURES FILE!"

"VERSION DATE: 2006-09-22"

"PREVIOUS VERSION DATE: Thu Sep 23 08:00:07 PDT 2004"

"These features can be used by all the grammars.  If a language has a
given feature, it must use one of these values.  New values can be
added after approval by the feature committee.  New features can be
added as they become more universal."

"This feature declaration should be called in the grammars as:

FEATURES (STANDARD COMMON) (STANDARD YOUR-LANGUAGE).

To modify these features and their values use the edit
operators provided in xle.  In your feature declaration you can:"

"0. Add a feature not declared here:
     CHECK: -> << [ _NCHECK _VCHECK ]. 

1. Use just a subset of the values:
     &CASE: -> $ { nom acc }.

2. Add in a new value for a feature here; these will be discussed at
the next meeting:
     +CASE: -> $ { finnish12 finnish13 finnish 14 }.

3. Completely replace a feature with new values; these will be discussed at
the next meeting:
     !CASE: -> $ { sg pl }.

4. Delete a feature that is not used in your grammar (e.g., remove
GEND in a language with no grammatical gender):
     !GEND: -> $ {}."

"Note that instantiated feature values are compatible with
noninstantiated feature value declarations."

"Any feature with non-atomic values can also have a CHECK feature as a
value; this is added by the grammars as needed."
