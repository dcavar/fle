   "This grammar is to be used with the information for those starting up
   pargram grammars (or others interested in this type of grammar).  It
   illustrates a number of the facilities provided by xle which the more
   theoretically trained grammar writers may not be familiar with.  There
   are comments throughout this file and the accompanying lexicon, but
   see the documentation file for more details.
