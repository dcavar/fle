You can download CLion from the [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

Students and faculty should be able to register with JetBrains for a free license for non-commercial use.
The [application page](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) will ask you for some details (including
email address), and when approved for the free license, you will use your login credentials to unlock
the different IDEs.


## Setting up plugins

When installing CLion, you will confirm various settings. One of the final dialogs will ask you whether you want to install some plugins.

I recommend installing the *Markdown* plugin from that dialog. This is the syntax of the documentation files that we are using.

The other plugins are not necessary. If you installed the IdeaVIM plugin, you might end up having trouble with a Vim-type of interface. To get rid of that, go to system settings in CLion, select plugins, and remove the IdeaVIM plugin.



## ANTLR4 Plugin for CLion

In CLion select File > Settings and the tab Plugins in the diloag window. Click on
"Browse repositories..." and scroll down to ANTLR v4 grammar plugin. Click on the green Install button on
the left.
