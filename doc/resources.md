## XLE Resources

The grammar formalism and and some functions of XLE are explained in the [online documentation](http://www2.parc.com/isl/groups/nltt/xle/doc/xle_toc.html). Another place with documentation about [XLE is at the University of Konstanz](http://ling.uni-konstanz.de/pages/xle/) and [in particular here](http://ling.uni-konstanz.de/pages/xle/doc/xle_toc.html).

There is an online version of XLE, the [XLE-Web](http://clarino.uib.no/iness/xle-web) at [INESS](http://clarino.uib.no/iness/page) in Norway.


### XLE-Web

INESS in Norway is providing a free [XLE-Web] instance with many grammars (not for download, just for use online, if I understand correctly).



## XLFG

LaBRI is providing an online interface called [XLFG] for LFG and CFGs.
